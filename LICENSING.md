# Licensing Guide

Locus is licensed under the **PolyForm Small Business License 1.0.0**. This is a professional, standardized license designed to support independent developers and small businesses while requiring a commercial relationship with larger enterprises.

## Permitted Usage

You may use Locus for free for any purpose, including commercial and closed-source applications, provided your organization meets the **Small Business** criteria:

- **Revenue**: Gross annual revenue must be less than **USD 250,000** in the prior tax year.
- **Team Size**: Your organization must have fewer than **100 total individuals** (including employees and independent contractors).

## Enterprise Usage

Organizations that exceed the Small Business limits require a commercial license for closed-source usage.

### Why this model?

Unlike MIT or Apache licenses, the PolyForm Small Business license ensures that the maintainers can sustain the project by establishing a fair value exchange with large, profitable enterprises while keeping it free for the community.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Locus "Open Source"?

Technically, Locus is "Source Available." Because it restricts usage based on organization size/revenue, it does not meet the strict OSI Open Source Definition. However, the source code is fully public, and it is free for the vast majority of developers.

### Do I need to open-source my app?

No. Unlike GPL or AGPL, the PolyForm Small Business license does not require your application to be open-source, even if you are an individual or a small business.

### Where is the full license text?

The full legally-binding text is available in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.
